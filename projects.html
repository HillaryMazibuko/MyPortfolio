    <h3>Baseline Mapping – ADDA Emergency Unit (Salima)</h3>
    <p>
      This project focused on baseline GIS mapping to support emergency response
      and development planning activities in Salima District. Baseline mapping
      involved collecting accurate spatial data to establish an understanding
      of existing conditions before the implementation of humanitarian or
      development interventions.
    </p>
    <p>
      My role included GPS-based field data collection, verification of spatial
      features, and contributing to the preparation of reliable geospatial
      datasets. The collected data supported decision-making processes related
      to emergency preparedness, resource allocation, and community-level
      planning.

    <h3>Land Survey Fieldwork – Golomoti, Mangochi</h3>
    <p>
      This project involved hands-on land survey fieldwork conducted in Golomoti,
      Mangochi, focusing on cadastral and boundary surveys for land administration
      purposes. The work aimed to support accurate land parcel definition and
      improve land management practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Activities included parcel measurements, boundary demarcation, GPS data
      capture, and ground truthing to ensure spatial accuracy. The fieldwork
      strengthened practical surveying skills and provided real-world experience
      in collecting and validating spatial data for legal and planning use.

  <!-- PROJECT 3 -->
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Dumpsite Suitability GIS Model – Lilongwe City</h3>
    <p>
      This project was a GIS-based analytical study aimed at identifying suitable
      locations for waste disposal sites within Lilongwe City. The objective was
      to support environmentally sound and socially acceptable waste management
      planning.
    </p>
    <p>
      A multi-criteria decision analysis approach was applied using spatial data
      such as land use, slope, proximity to settlements, hydrology, and
      infrastructure. The output included suitability maps and planning
      recommendations that can support informed decision-making by urban
      planners and environmental authorities.

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Personal GIS & Portfolio Website</h3>
    <p>
      This project involved the design and development of a personal portfolio
      website to professionally present my GIS, land surveying, and development
      work. The website serves as a digital platform for showcasing projects,
      skills, and field experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The site was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React concepts,
      with emphasis on responsive design, clear navigation, and structured
      presentation of technical content. This project strengthened my web
      development skills and ability to integrate geospatial work with modern
      digital platforms.

  <!-- PROJECT 5 -->
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Industrial Waste Management – Academic Project Report</h3>
    <p>
      This project was an academic research and reporting exercise focused on
      understanding how waste generated from industrial activities can be
      effectively managed to reduce environmental pollution and public health
      risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The study examined different categories of industrial waste, including
      solid, liquid, and hazardous waste, and reviewed appropriate handling,
      treatment, and disposal methods. Emphasis was placed on sustainable waste
      management practices, pollution prevention, and compliance with
      environmental regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project enhanced skills in environmental analysis, technical writing,
      and sustainable planning, while providing a strong theoretical foundation
      in industrial waste management principles.
