  <div class="card">
    <h3>Baseline Mapping – ADDA Emergency Unit (Salima)</h3>
    <p>
      This project focused on baseline GIS mapping to support emergency response
      and development planning activities in Salima District. Baseline mapping
      involved collecting accurate spatial data to establish an understanding
      of existing conditions before the implementation of humanitarian or
      development interventions.
    </p>
    <p>
      My role included GPS-based field data collection, verification of spatial
      features, and contributing to the preparation of reliable geospatial
      datasets. The collected data supported decision-making processes related
      to emergency preparedness, resource allocation and community-level
      planning.

<div class="card">
  <h3>SBAPP Project – Land Cover Map Accuracy Assessment (MUST)</h3>

  <p>
    This project involved participation in a land cover map accuracy assessment
    workshop conducted at the Malawi University of Science and Technology (MUST)
    under the Spatial Biodiversity Assessments, Prioritization and Planning
    (SBAPP) project. The initiative was implemented in collaboration with the
    Environmental Affairs Department (EAD) and other key national stakeholders.
  </p>

  <p>
    The activity contributed to the update of Malawi’s national land cover map,
    originally released in 2010, which is a critical resource for ecological
    mapping, biodiversity assessment, and sustainable land use planning. The
    assessment focused on evaluating the accuracy and reliability of newly
    generated land cover maps.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the workshop, I participated in the evaluation of land cover
    classifications generated using Google Earth Engine, working alongside
    experts from the Departments of Surveys, Forestry, Land Resources, Physical
    Planning and the Malawi Environmental Protection Authority (MEPA). The
    exercise strengthened skills in spatial validation, accuracy assessment,
    collaborative GIS workflows, and the use of cloud-based geospatial analysis
    tools.

    <h3>Dumpsite Suitability GIS Model – Lilongwe City</h3>
    <p>
      This project was a GIS-based analytical study aimed at identifying suitable
      locations for waste disposal sites within Lilongwe City. The objective was
      to support environmentally sound and socially acceptable waste management
      planning.
    </p>
    <p>
      A multi-criteria decision analysis approach was applied using spatial data
      such as land use, slope, proximity to settlements, hydrology and
      infrastructure. The output included suitability maps and planning
      recommendations that can support informed decision-making by urban
      planners and environmental authorities.

    <h3>Industrial Waste Management – Project</h3>
    <p>
      This project was an academic research and reporting exercise focused on
      understanding how waste generated from industrial activities can be
      effectively managed to reduce environmental pollution and public health
      risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The study examined different categories of industrial waste, including
      solid, liquid, and hazardous waste, and reviewed appropriate handling,
      treatment and disposal methods. Emphasis was placed on sustainable waste
      management practices, pollution prevention, and compliance with
      environmental regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project enhanced skills in environmental analysis, technical writing
      and sustainable planning, while providing a strong theoretical foundation
      in industrial waste management principles.

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Land Survey Fieldwork – Golomoti, Mangochi</h3>
    <p>
      This project involved hands-on land survey fieldwork conducted in Golomoti,
      Mangochi, focusing on cadastral and boundary surveys for land administration
      purposes. The work aimed to support accurate land parcel definition and
      improve land management practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Activities included parcel measurements, boundary demarcation, GPS data
      capture and ground truthing to ensure spatial accuracy. The fieldwork
      strengthened practical surveying skills and provided real-world experience
      in collecting and validating spatial data for legal and planning use.

    <h3>Personal GIS & Portfolio Website</h3>
    <p>
      This project involved the design and development of a personal portfolio
      website to professionally present my GIS, land surveying and development
      work. The website serves as a digital platform for showcasing projects,
      skills and field experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The site was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React concepts,
      with emphasis on responsive design, clear navigation and structured
      presentation of technical content. This project strengthened my web
      development skills and ability to integrate geospatial work with modern
      digital platforms.
